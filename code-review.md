# Module: No. 9 - Working with APIs
# Project: Color Scheme Generator by Jordan
# Code Reviewer: Shant Dashjian


## What You Did Well:

1. You met the requirements of this project:
    1. Choose seed color with input of type=“color”.
    2. Choose color scheme mode with <select> box.
    3. Clicking button makes request to the Color API.
    4. Display the colors and their hex values.
2. Your code is well-organized.
3. You followed CSS and JS naming conventions.


## Suggestions for Improvement:

1. In regards to the code you left behind for your attempt to implement the copying functionality, you were on the right track and you were almost there. See the tweeks I made to make it work.
2. While it may be useful to have comments to explain what you did, when it comes to production code, make your code self-documenting by naming your functions and variables well, which you do. Thus you no longer need to add plenty of comments. Keep your code "clean" by reserving your comment to explain why you did something in a certain way if it was not obvious, or to explain a regular expression.


## Conclusion:

Well done working on this project. I hope you found my suggestions useful. Keep on coding.
